the first ethics proposal was rejected in 08/17 with remarks in statistical matters as well as missing information about the numer of persons needed.
After a meeting with the person responsible for ethics in the commitee, I rewrote the missing or reamrked points and hope to submit the document within end of the week (3.11.17)
