# ethic proposal 
The ethic votum was rejected in 08/17 because of missunderstandings in the description of statistical analysis as well as groupnumber and some minor critics.
I rewrote the critical parts and after a meeting with the responsable person of statistics at the ethical commitee, I will submit the new document until end of this week (3.11.17).
