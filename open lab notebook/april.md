# Week 16.4.- 20.4.
# to do: 
- write Data management plan
- upload ethics proposal
- write appendum for ethics proposal for data sharing
- create new aritmethic tasks for second stresstest
- write mail to prof. nater: we will send him salivettes for testing our skills in MRI environment, ask him if he could send us his data of stress music paradigm to have the possibilty to compare the results with ours
- write "antrag auf annahme als doktorand"
- prepare presentation abour stress paradigm for next weeks meeting
- update knowledge of python etc.
- ask Jens about financing salivette (-> probably our lab is financing it)

# upcoming
- visit in Regensburg to get to see the stresstest on april 26

# week 23.4.- 27.4.
- Regensburg: we visited Regensburg to learn more about the scanSTRESS, the stresstest we would like to use in our experiment. We gained a lot of important and helpful information: We can vary the subtraction tasks into subtraction by 17 instead of 13. 
- The very first subject should not be tested before 13:oo but can be tested until the late afternoon. 
- to test the capability of the subject to handle the saliva sampling in the scanner, a first sample is taken before the test after having embeded the subject in the scanner
- we should try to shorten the the time of transfer of the subject between introduction (questionnaires) and MRI
- they use the PANAS to evaluate anxiety instead of STAI-S
- the observer panel should be male and female

- I finished the addendum for my ethics proposal; still need to show it to Andreas if we can hand it in like this
- Worked on the data management plan for OSF --> waiting for feedback from the group. Topic for weekly meeting with Peer.
- Continued working on my Introduction and Methods Part of my thesis.


# to do:
- talk to Jens concerning scanner time --> wednesdays and freidays could be possible, saturdays as well. Michael will take part in the project as observer, we still need a female observer; next week wednesday first try of scanSTRESS in the scanner
- get the video running (cam records the whole time. Regensburg uses "capture pad")
- try the saliva sampling in the scanner
- buy Buzzer 
- send paper about graph theory and cyclic differences of saliva cortisol in women to Regensburg, ask for their texts for the stresstest
- ask Nater if we could also take 6 saliva samples (1 when subject is still outside the scanner, 1 while subjects is introduced to the scanner, 1 after stresstest 1, 1 after acoustic intervention, 1 after stresstest 2 and 1 after having finished the whole paradigme, outside the scanner.
- as his team currently is interested in testing eye tracking during the stress task, we will do that too and transmit our data to them
