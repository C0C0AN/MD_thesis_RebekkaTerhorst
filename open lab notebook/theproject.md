# hooked on a feeling - Eine Pilotstudie zur Untersuchung des Einflusses neuronaler Korrelate von Musikhören auf Stresserleben- und reduktion
In my project, I will analyse the structural influences music has on the stressed brain. The structure of the project is similar to a project without fMRI analysis (Thoma, M. V., La Marca, R., Brönnimann, R., Finkel, L., Ehlert, U., & Nater, U. M. (2013). The Effect of Music on the Human Stress Response.) 
I postulate the hypothesis that interaction of music and stress takes part in neuronal connections and leads to a faster relaxation than an exposure to stress without music listening afterwoods.
To compare 2 acoustical stimuli within the project, we want to create 2 major groups (1+2)which then will be subdevided again into 2 minor groups (1.1+1.2+2.1+2.2).
All of these groups will undergo a paradigm similar to the TSST (Trier Stress Inventory) for approx. 10 min during an fMRI run.
Group 1 will then be exposed to a piece of music (Miserere, Allegri https://archive.org/details/MiserereGregorioAllegri), for about 10 min. 
Group 2 will listen to "natural sounds" which are said to have a relaxing component as well.
After the acoustic intervention both groups will have to undergo the stress paradigm again. 
To ensure that there will be no habitational artefacts due to repitition of stimuli, we have created a slightly different variation of the stress test.
The tests will be randomized. e.g. group 1.1 will get the first stress test first, have the music intervention and then get the second stress test. While group 1.2 will undergo the diefferent stress tests in inverse order (second stress test - music intervention- first stress test).
The stress test consists of mathematical and rotational tasks the person has to solve under time pressure while getting a visual feedback via video from the peoject manager. After solving a question the person gets a visual comparison of his performance in comparison to other persons. 
The level of difficulty will be adjusted by the stress paradigm. This ensures, that the person won't solve more then some percent of the tasks, which in combination with the social feedback leeds to a higher stress reaction.
The second stress test will have the same amount of tasks, but won't adjust the level of difficulty. This test is more "easier". 
During the paradigm we will test the salivary cortsiol regularly as well as heart rate, skin conductance level and respiratory rate to indicate a stress situation.
Also the study person will have to answer some questions about his musicality and personal stress level as well as indicate the actual stress level after each stress and acoustic intervention period.
