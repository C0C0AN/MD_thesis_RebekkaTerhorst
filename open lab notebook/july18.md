# week 2.7.-6.7.
- tried to run CPAC 
- problems: couldn't enable qc
- crash log: could not create datasink; couldn't find input file for BET
- CPAC didn't run properly with  the following settings in the pipeline:





- tried some changes in the pipeline settings with which in the test-configuration qc was possible to be enabled
- I created a new file structure as well for the different outputs into my output folder : working, output, crashlog and log-directory

- additionally I read about MNE, a python based module which we want to use to analyse our physiological data (gsr, respiration, heart ferquency) and adapted a script from Malte Gueth. I uploaded it in the "Code" folder. Currently the settings remain provisionaly. the channels need to be more precisly defined. As well as I need to read further into the concrete function of "epochs".
