# week 30th- 3th november
I edited the second version of my ethics proposal and wrote the statement for the ethics committee. Hopefully ready to be submitted
For better understanding my project I uploaded a short description in github.
I looked for sound examples for natural sounds - we'll take water sounds as Nater used them as well in his studies
