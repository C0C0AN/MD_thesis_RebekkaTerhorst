# whole december update
- as I didn't have much time, I recall the last weeks in this file.
- we tried the paradigm of the stresstest in the MR. It didn't work out as predicted. The main problem seems to be the video feedback, which plays recorded pictures in fast forward mood. So that's the next part to be changed.
- we still need to try out the music and natural sounds in MR environement.
- the ethics proposal was revised, this time with more tiny changes, which I corrected. Hopefully nect revision will stay without any further revisions.
